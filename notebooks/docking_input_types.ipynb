    "# Different Input Types For Docking\n",
    "`DockStream` currently supports four ways to input ligands: as smiles from the console, as smiles from a text file (no header, one smile per line), as smiles from a CSV (with header) and as 3D-embedded molecules from a SDF. Below are examples of how the input blocks could look like. Use the `type` setting to specify the nature of the input (if it is missing, `DockStream` will try to infer it, but this is not recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console\n",
    "This mode is mainly used to feed in a couple of compounds from the console directly for testing, but is also the way of interaction between [`REINVENT`](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent) and `DockStream`. If set, the `docker.py` entry point expects a `-smiles` parameter with the value \"smile1;smile2;smile3\" (do not forget the quotation marks), i.e. the `SMILES` separated by a semi-colon `;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `DockStream` configuration file, use the following block:\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "  \"input\": {\n",
    "    \"standardize_smiles\": false,\n",
    "    \"type\": \"console\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The respective call will look something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<path_to_conda_environment>/python docker.py -conf <input.json> -smiles \"C#CCCCn1c(Cc2cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c2Cl)nc2c(N)ncnc21;CCCCn1c(Cc2cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c2)nc2c(N)ncnc21;CCCCn1c(Cc2cc(OC)ccc2OC)nc2c(N)ncnc21\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text file with smiles\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "  \"input\": {\n",
    "    \"standardize_smiles\": False,\n",
    "    \"input_path\": \"<path_to_text_file>\",\n",
    "    \"type\": \"smi\"                                   \n",
    "  },\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that `DockStream` expects one `SMILE` per line (without quotation marks) and without additional columns. If you need to input the name of the compounds as well, please use a `CSV` file (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSV with smiles\n",
    "For this type of input, you need to specify the delimiter and at least the column name of the `smiles`. You may want to add a `names` column as well, which will cause the names to be retained throughout the run (they are added to the output files). Other columns are ignored (but a header line is mandatory). The example below would work for a `CSV` file with the columns `SMILES` and `Names_Compounds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "  \"input\": {\n",
    "    \"standardize_smiles\": false,\n",
    "     \"input_path\": \"<path_to_csv>\",\n",
    "     \"type\": \"csv\",\n",
    "     \"delimiter\": \",\",\n",
    "     \"columns\": {\n",
    "       \"smiles\": \"SMILES\",\n",
    "       \"names\": \"Names_Compounds\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "  },\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SDF with molecules\n",
    "If embedded molecules are fed in, there will be no embedding taking place (i.e. the initial coordinates are retained until the docking stage).. You may want to specify a tag that holds the names of the molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "  \"input\": {\n",
    "    \"input_path\": \"<path_to_sdf>\",\n",
    "    \"type\": \"sdf\",\n",
    "    \"tags\": {\n",
    "      \"names\": \"CUSTOM_NAME\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  },\n",
